**`(Developer/Data Scientist/Cloud Practitioner)`**

Lemme yap about myself:<br>
I am **`VANSH`** <br>
<br>
Fueled by chai(tea) and code, I'm a B.Tech student diving into the realms of data science and AI.<br>
I claim myself to be **`a cloud enthusiast, data storyteller, and full-stack developer etc. etc. Call me whatever you want ;)`**
<br>
 When I'm not crunching numbers, you’ll find me whipping up passion projects as a full stack developer!
